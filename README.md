# Leila Airlines

The Leila Airlines website allows users to search for and book flights, including making a purchase by entering credit card information. This Rails apps includes a search form that allows users to select the origin airport, destination airport, number of passengers, and travel date. After confirming the flight, users can select whether they want the site to remember their credit card info and whether to use the site's built-in checkout system or to route their purchase through Expedia. 

All payment gateways and integrations use *test* systems. To test the payment system, use any of the [test credit cards](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/test-data/).
